# Remixer Remote for Web

Remixer helps teams use and refine design specs by providing an abstraction for these values that is accessible and configurable from both inside and outside the app itself.

## Quickstart

#### 1. Sign up for Firebase.

Remixer remote will work with any new or existing Firebase account. It will use the [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) feature to host this remote controller. If you don't have an existing Firebase account you wish to use, you can signup following instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com).

#### 2. Use `npm` to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
# Run the following script from root of this repo
npm install
```

#### 3. Add your Firebase credentials.

Add your Firebase credentials to the `index.html` file located in the `src` folder.

```javascript
// TODO: Replace with your project's info.
var config = {
  apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
  authDomain: "<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com",
};
```

#### 4. Build and deploy the library to your Firebase Hosting account.

Running the following script will generate a new `public` folder first with all of the required files. It will then copy these files to your Firebase Hosting storage. 

```bash
# Run the following script from root of this repo
npm run deploy -- --project=<PROJECT_ID>
```

#### 5. Your site is now ready.

The Remixer remote controller will now be available at:
```
https://<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com/<REMOTE_ID>
```
